Memoization and DP, Easy, 30 pts

Pentagonal numbers are the number of dots that can be shown in a pentagonal
pattern of dots. Let's represent the nth pentagonal number by P(n). The
following figure depicts pentagonal patterns for n âˆˆ {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
Your task is to find the value of P(n) for a given n.
