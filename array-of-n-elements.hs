FP/Introduction, Easy, 10 pts

Create an array of n integers, where the value of n is passed as an argument to
the pre-filled function in your editor. This challenge uses a custom checker,
so you can create any array of n integers. For example, if n=4, you could return
[1,1,1,1], [1,2,3,4], or any other array of equal length.
